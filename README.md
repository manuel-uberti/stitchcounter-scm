# stitchcounter-scm

Command line tool to help you with knitting and crocheting.

It is a porting in [Chicken Scheme](http://call-cc.org/) of the same program I
wrote in [Clojure](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/stitchcounter-clj) and in
[C](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/c-bag/blob/master/stitchcounter.c).

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/manuel-uberti/stitchcounter-scm.git
